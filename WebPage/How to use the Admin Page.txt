How to use the Admin Page of the Website

It's set up right now to Add or Edit Items, Categories, and Sub-Categories, but the functions haven't been implemented.

To Add Items Click on the Add or Edit Items Tab and then fill out the form and click save.
At the top it will show that it's been added after the file is downloaded and reuploaded to the server.

To Edit Items, either Search for the item you want to edit or on the item list click on the Category and then the Item.
Either way it will fill in the form for you. Edit the item and click save and it will show that it was changed at the top.

To Add Categories click on the Add or Edit Categories tab and leave it as New Categories and type in the name and click save.

To Add Sub-Categories click on the tab and click on the Category it goes under, then have it be New Sub-Category.
Type in the name of the Sub-Category and click save.

To Edit either a Cateogry or Sub-Category just click on the corresponding Category or Sub-Category and it will fill in the box.
Edit the name to what you want and click save.

To make the changes permanent at the top there is a list of changes, and if you made a mistake, it can be removed,
or you can download the file to replace the old file on the server and it will make the changes permanent.
